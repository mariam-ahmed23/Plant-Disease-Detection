# Plant-Disease-Detection
# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project detects plant leaf diseases using deep learning techniques.  
It includes two models — a **custom CNN** and a **VGG16-based transfer learning model** — trained on the **PlantVillage dataset** and deployed as an interactive web app using **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Features
- Two classification models:
  - **Custom CNN** built from scratch  
  - **VGG16-based model** using transfer learning  
- **Data preprocessing** and **augmentation** for better generalization  
- **Model evaluation** using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- **Streamlit web app** for real-time plant disease detection from uploaded leaf images

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **Keras**  
- **Streamlit** for deployment  
- **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
